Blockchain-Based Milk Delivery Platform for Stallholder Dairy Farmers
Enforcing Transparency and Fair Payment

Overview
We have developed a blockchain-based milk delivery platform to ensure transparency, trust, and fair payments for smallholder dairy farmers. Many farmers are often exploited by middlemen who manipulate transaction records and underpay them. To combat this, our platform leverages blockchain technology to provide a tamper-proof, decentralized system that secures milk delivery transactions and payments.

Objectives
Build a decentralized blockchain platform to store milk delivery records securely.
Provide farmers with real-time access to their transaction history.
Eliminate fraudulent middlemen and ensure fair pricing.
Enable farmers to use verified transactions as financial collateral.
Offer market prices, weather forecasts, and disease control information for better decision-making.
Technical Implementation
Blockchain Ledger: A decentralized, immutable ledger records all milk deliveries.
Smart Contracts: Automates payments based on transaction verification.
SHA-256 Cryptographic Hashing: Secures data against manipulation.
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network: Ensures data availability and redundancy.
How It Works
Farmers deliver milk to Milk Collection Centers (MBCs).
Milk transactions, including quantity, price, and timestamps, are automatically recorded on the blockchain.
A web application allows farmers and staff to view transaction details and generate payment reports.
Farmers can monitor earnings and use their transaction history for financial assistance.
Benefits
✔ Full transparency – Farmers can verify payments without intermediaries.
✔ Fair payments – Automated, tamper-proof records prevent exploitation.
✔ Secure data management – Blockchain ensures records are immutable and accessible.
✔ Financial empowerment – Farmers can access loans and subsidies based on verified transactions.
